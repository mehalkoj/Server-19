# Server-19

This is a home project for my family. It is mainly used to use abandoned games and other games I bought to be easily downloaded from an area. Now instead of having to move flash drives of these old games or ones that are bought my family now downloads it directly from an apache server that is on a raspberry pi. 
It was made with html, css, and php.

It is very rough looking and it became my playground with frameworks and not the best coding practices.
